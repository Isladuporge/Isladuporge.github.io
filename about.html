                    <p>My research is taxonomically broad and driven by methodological innovation to improve wildlife detection and tracking techniques with a focus on socially migratory species. I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of terrestrial and marine mammals across diverse biomes, including elephants, lions, olive baboons, and cetaceans such as southern right whales, beluga whales, and the magical narwhal in the Arctic.
                    <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Oxford and have conducted research for various
                        government agencies, such as the United States Army Research Office, the United Nations Office
                        on Drugs and Crime program on combating wildlife and forest crime, the government of Saudi Arabia, and
                        The Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. My research primarily focuses on advancing techniques that use remote sensing satellite imagery and UAV
                        monitoring combined with machine learning techniques to track wildlife. However, due to the flexibility of methods required to adequately track wildlife at different scales, in the course of my career I have also been involved in 
                        aircraft surveys from a helicopter, twin otters in the Arctic, and in sub-aquatic missions, including during diving expeditions and in a submersible. I have worked with acoustic and
                        biological sampling methodologies, including using geophones, hydrophones, and eDNA sampling. I am a
                        commercially certified operator of multicopter and fixed-wing UAVs, as well as an advanced nitrox-certified
                        deep-water diver. Since 2017, I have been an
