                    <p>I am a computational ethologist studying how new technologies can improve wildlife monitoring, with a focus on using satellite and UAV remote sensing combined with deep learning to track social mammals. All of my work is collaborative, and I have been fortunate to work with many excellent scientists on projects across a wide range of species and biomes. 

 <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Oxford and am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University <span class="link"></span>
                        <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/isla-duporge" target="_blank" class="nav-button" style="color: cornflowerblue;">[Institutional page]</a>. My work has taken me into collaborations with several government organizations, including the U.S. Army Research Office (where I spent 2.5 years contributing to a program on cryptic ground data analysis), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (wildlife and forest crime), the Government of Saudi Arabia, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

 <p>While my core expertise is in satellite and UAV-based monitoring, I have also gained experience with complementary wildlife tracking methods, from aerial surveys in helicopters and Twin Otters in the Arctic to diving and submersible missions in Saudi Arabia, and acoustic and biological sampling using geophones (South Africa), hydrophones (Saudi Arabia), and eDNA sampling (Canadian Arctic).  I am a commercially certified operator of multicopter and fixed-wing UAVs, and an advanced nitrox-certified deep-water diver. Since 2017, I have been an \href{https://explorers.nationalgeographic.org/directory/isla-camille-duporge}{Explorer with the National Geographic Society}, working on projects that bring together technology and fieldwork, as well as projects supported by \href{https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/our-programs/lab/}{the Exploration Technology Lab}.
