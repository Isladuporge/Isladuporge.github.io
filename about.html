                    <p>As a computational ethologist, my research focuses on advancing wildlife monitoring through novel detection and tracking methodologies. I am particularly focused on applying satellite and UAV remote sensing in combination with deep learning to the study of social mammals. I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of taxa across diverse biomes. I hold a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Oxford and have conducted research for various organizations, including the U.S. Army Research Office, where I worked for 2.5 years on a cryptic ground data analysis program, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime program on combating wildlife and forest crime, the Government of Saudi Arabia, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. While my core expertise lies in satellite and UAV remote sensing combined with machine learning, I also have experience with complementary tracking methods and have been involved in aerial surveys using helicopters and Twin Otters, to sub-aquatic missions including diving and submersibles (Saudi Arabia), to acoustic and biological sampling with geophones (South Africa), hydrophones (Saudi Arabia), and eDNA sampling (Canadian Arctic).
 <p>I am a commercially certified operator of multicopter and fixed-wing UAVs, and an advanced nitrox-certified deep-water diver. Since 2017, I have been an
