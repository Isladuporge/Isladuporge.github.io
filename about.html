                    <p>My research focuses on improving wildlife detection and tracking techniques to provide more
                        detailed insights into species abundance, habitat use, and collective behavior. While my work
                        primarily centers on social migratory species, it remains taxonomically broad. I have had the
                        opportunity to work with a variety of terrestrial and marine mammals across diverse biomes,
                        including elephants, baboons, and narwhals.

                    <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Oxford and have conducted research for various
                        government agencies, such as the United States Army Research Office, the United Nations Office
                        on Drugs and Crime program on combatting wildlife and forest crime, the government of Saudi Arabia, and
                        Fisheries and Oceans Canada. My research primarily employs satellite and UAV
                        monitoring combined with machine learning techniques but I have also conducted manned
                        aircraft surveys from helicopter and twin otters in the Arctic. Additionally, I have worked with acoustic and
                        biological sampling methodologies, including geophones, hydrophones, and eDNA sampling. I am a
                        certified multicopter and fixed-wing UAV pilot, as well as an advanced nitrox-certified
                        deep-water diver. Since 2017, I have been an
